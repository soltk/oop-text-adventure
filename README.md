A. GAME DESCRIPTION
 
	The objective of the game is to escape from a haunted mansion.  
	The player will need to find and use items, navigate the mansion, and encounter 
	and fight enemies.  
	The game ends when the player is either defeated or successfully escapes.
 	
 	This single-player game is called Mansion Escape and is structured as a text adventure 
 	that incorporates various topics we have learned in OOP. The objective of the game is 
 	to escape a haunted mansion by moving from room to room in search of the next open door 
 	and any useful items that may help the player escape or fight off the monsters that 
 	may lurk within. The player begins in the lobby, moves through the bar, the kitchen, 
 	the hallway, the master bedroom, and the bathroom until they reach outside. Through 
 	each room, the user is presented with a puzzle or task, and the various rooms may be 
 	locked or closed, so the user must take the textual clues to discover where they can 
 	go next.
 	
 	At the conclusion of the game, the user must defeat the final enemy to make it to 
 	their car, which can only be accessed if the player had picked up their car keys in 
 	one of the previous rooms. There are different endings depending on player actions, 
 	so it is essentially a “Choose your own adventure” game. The game serves as a mix 
 	between storytelling and problem solving although it lacks an actual UI or graphics, 
 	so it will hopefully entertain players who are highly imaginative and love reading 
 	and logic puzzles!
 	
B. HOW TO PLAY

	Once the game begins, type 'help' for a list of commands.  Using 'go' *must* be followed by a direction
